# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
This project is intended to develop a VBA script that will quickly comb through thousands of lines of data to pull 
our pertinent information for specificed variables (stock symbols). This allows end users to quickly examine valuable data points and provide even more
value to their end users. In this case, we were able to assist Steve by building a macro that looped through 2017/2018 data sets and calculated certain fields based on required information.


## Results: 
Overall, it appears that 2017 was a much better year for stocks with only one ticket in the red.
The following year only saw two tickers that were poristive.  Both of those two were up over 80%.  Both run times were very similiar on my machine,
assuming that the script is correct.  The numbers did match the images in the module 2 challenge navigator.  

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
It is a great tool to be able to modify outputs and logic without what the end user feels and sees.  It allows the developer to make 
any interface more adaptive and interactive.  It allows us to enhance the code as much as possible without costly deployments and lengthened UAT, all while
getting rid of tech debt.  It can be tricky refactoring legacy code in the sense that you were not the one to write it 
and you were to take it over if an employee before you left.  You might not have the best understanding of the entire script and can easily break
the script.  

##The above plays a small part in refactoring the legacy VBA code. Compared to 'real world' scripts, this VBA project was small and understandable.
Scaling issues can start to become an issue when the project gets too big and has too many different applications, stakeholders, and outputs.
